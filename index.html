<p>Convertsation is a gamified public website that adds structure to online intellectual and current event forums. This approach will promote discussions which are approachable, constructive, and therefore authentically intriguing. Joining chat rooms with two to five people, members will be algorithmically placed in groups which contain users with different beliefs. These diverse users both enable constructive Convertsations and combat our increasingly polarized community. There will be three main Convertsation structures; 1) text chat table, 2) text with vocal table, and 3) text, audio and video capable table. These Convertsation tables will have restrictions and guidelines to maintain positive and productive communications.</p>

<p>Prior to every Convertsation, users must answer a brief survey regarding their opinions. The answers will determine their placement in a group Convertsation. At the conclusion of each Convertsation, another brief survey regarding the participant&rsquo;s experience must be taken. These surveys will be stored on the user&rsquo;s account, and once the surveys are completed, discussion members will be allocated experience for completing a full Convertsation. Users will receive bonuses for accomplishments, called &ldquo;Experience&rdquo;, such as post-survey statements which support that the participant gained new insight on the topic discussed in Convertsation. Users will be offered the opportunity to gain Experience Points by reading articles approaching the topic from a variety of different aspects. Optional quizzes for the articles will be offered for additional Experience Points.</p>

<p>Experience Points are designed to &ldquo;level up&rdquo; members. Available to Higher Level users will be Convertsations and Special Guests exclusive to each of Higher Levels. Additional advantages will be implemented.</p>
